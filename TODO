# This is just a random list of things that I think need to be done
# to rteval
#

1. Figure out how to add more loads. Seems that we could do it two ways:

   - create a wrapper python module just like is done for kcompile and hackbench
     then add the new module to a config file so rteval loads it on startup
     (i.e. a plugin architecture)

   - figure out some generic load wrapper so that arbitrary commands may be
     used as loads. 

2. Should we add a hwlatdetect option?

3. Potential new loads/measurements:
   - dbench
   - AMQP latencytest/perftest (over loopback)
   - bonnie/bonnie++
   - iozone
