1. Write a man page.

2. Figure out some sort of config file to adjust load and measurement parameters, then
add an option to tell rteval to use a particular config file.

3. Figure out how to add more loads. Seems that we could do it two ways:

   - create a wrapper python module just like is done for kcompile and hackbench
     then add the new module to a config file so rteval loads it on startup

   - figure out some generic load wrapper so that arbitrary commands may be
     used as loads. 

   Heck, maybe we could do both.
